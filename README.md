# Twitch User Finder
This is simple script I made in my free time to use [Twitch](twitch.tv)'s public API. It's used to find Twitch users in channels, because who doesn't want to know what channels their friends who have the "OFFLINE" status are watching / lurking in..
also can be used to find sub gifters ðŸ˜‰
